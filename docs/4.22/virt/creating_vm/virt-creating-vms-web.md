# Virtual machine creation wizard reference

The virtual machine (VM) creation wizard in the web console presents several options that affect how a VM runs. The following tables describe the options that have the greatest impact.

## Boot source options

On the **Boot source** page, you can select an existing boot volume or click **Add volume** to create one. When you add a volume, the **Source type** list determines where the boot disk image comes from.

| Source type           | Description                                                                        | When to use                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Volume (upload new)   | Uploads a persistent volume claim (PVC) image or ISO file from your local machine. | You have a disk image or ISO on your workstation. Select **This is an ISO file** for installation media.                    |
| Volume (use existing) | Reuses a volume that is already available on the cluster.                          | A boot volume is already prepared in the cluster.                                                                           |
| Volume snapshot       | Creates a boot disk from an existing volume snapshot.                              | You want fast provisioning from a point-in-time image.                                                                      |
| Registry              | Imports a container disk from a container registry.                                | The image is published to a registry such as Quay. Requires a container image URL and, for private registries, credentials. |
| URL                   | Imports an image from an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint.                                   | The image is hosted at a web address. Select **TLS certificate required** for endpoints that need a certificate.            |

Boot source types

When you add a volume, the following settings affect how the disk is stored and identified:

**Preference**
The preferred VM attribute values required to run a given workload, such as the guest operating system. The preference influences default values elsewhere in the wizard.

**Default InstanceType**
The default instance type associated with the boot volume.

**StorageClass**
The storage class used to provision the volume. The default storage class is used unless you select another.

**Volume Mode**
Determines whether the volume is presented as a raw block device (**Block**) or a formatted file system (**Filesystem**).

**Access Mode**
Controls how many nodes can mount the volume: shared access (**RWX**), single-user (**RWO**), or read-only (**ROX**). Live migration requires shared access (**RWX**).

## Instance type series

On the **Compute resources** page, you select an instance type series and then a size. The series determines the CPU and memory characteristics of the VM. Some series require specially configured nodes.

| Series | Name              | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                     | Node requirement                                                                              |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| U      | General Purpose   | Neutral, general-purpose resources. VMs share physical CPU cores with other VMs on a time-slice basis.                                                              | None                                                                                          |
| O      | Overcommitted     | Based on the U series, but memory is overcommitted.                                                                                                                 | None                                                                                          |
| CX     | Compute Exclusive | Exclusive compute resources for compute-intensive workloads, with dedicated CPUs, isolated emulator threads, and virtual non-uniform memory access (NUMA) topology. | CPU manager enabled and huge pages available on the nodes.                                    |
| M      | Memory Intensive  | Resources for memory-intensive workloads, with burstable CPU performance.                                                                                           | None                                                                                          |
| D      | Dedicated vCPU    | Consistent, predictable performance. VMs are assigned exclusive physical CPU cores, which avoids CPU sharing and time-slice contention.                             | None                                                                                          |
| N      | Network           | Resources for network-intensive Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workloads, such as virtual network functions (VNFs).                                              | Nodes capable of running DPDK workloads and labeled with `node-role.kubevirt.io/worker-dpdk`. |
| RT     | Realtime          | Resources for realtime workloads, such as `oslat`.                                                                                                                  | Nodes capable of running realtime workloads.                                                  |

Instance type series

Instance types are named in the format `series.size`, where the size ranges from `nano` to `8xlarge`. For example, `u1.medium` provides 1 vCPU and 4 GiB of memory. You can select a **Red Hat provided** instance type or a **User provided** instance type that an administrator has defined.

## Customization settings

The optional **Customization** step groups advanced settings into tabs. The following settings are the ones that most commonly affect VM behavior.

| Setting                        | Tab         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Disk interface                 | Storage     | Determines disk performance and compatibility. **VirtIO** offers the best performance but requires additional drivers on Windows. **SATA** has lower performance but is supported by most operating systems, including Windows. **SCSI** supports large numbers of devices. |
| Ephemeral disk                 | Storage     | Adds a disk from a container image whose changes are lost when the VM reboots.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Use this disk as a boot source | Storage     | Marks a disk as bootable. Only one disk can be bootable at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Headless mode                  | Details     | Removes the default graphics device. VNC console access is not available when this option is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Dynamic SSH key injection      | SSH         | Injects a public SSH key that is applied without restarting the VM. When it is not enabled, keys are applied through `virtctl`.                                                                                                                                             |
| Labels and annotations         | Metadata    | **Labels** are key-value pairs that you can query to organize and select VMs. **Annotations** store arbitrary metadata that cannot be queried.                                                                                                                              |
