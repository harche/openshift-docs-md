Before installing the NVIDIA DPF Operator, you must set up the management cluster, configure worker nodes, and install and configure the required Operators.

# Set up the management cluster

The management cluster is a standard OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 cluster installed by using the Assisted Installer. This cluster hosts the DPF Operators and the hosted control planes for managing the hosted cluster on DPUs.

- You have access to the [Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create).

- You have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

1.  Go to the [Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console cluster creation page](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create) and create a cluster with control-plane nodes only. Select **Data center** → **Assisted Installer**.

2.  Optional: Configure jumbo MTU for each control plane node.

    1.  Under **Hosts' network configuration** in the Assisted Installer wizard, select **Static IP, bridges, and bonds**.

    2.  Set the **Static network configurations** section per node according to the following template, using the relevant MAC address and interface name for each node:

        ``` yaml
        interfaces:
          - ipv4:
              dhcp: true
              enabled: true
            mac-address: <xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx>
            mtu: 1500 # Set to 1500 for standard MTU or 9000 for jumbo frames
            name: <interface-name>
            state: up
            type: ethernet
        ```

        <div class="note">

        - You can alternatively configure MTU allocation on the DHCP server that allocates IPs to the control plane nodes.

        - If virtual machines are used for control-plane nodes, the MTU must be set on the bridge of the hypervisor used by the VMs.

        - When using MTU 9000, ensure the switch ports that connect the cluster’s control-plane nodes are set to handle jumbo frames.

        </div>

3.  Select the following operators to install with the cluster:

    - **Storage** → **Logical Volume Manager Storage**

    - **Platform Operations & Lifecycle** → **MultiCluster Engine**

    - **Scheduling** → **Node Feature Discovery**

4.  Click **Add hosts** to add hosts to the cluster. Only control plane nodes are required at this stage.

5.  After the installation completes, download the `KUBECONFIG` file and save it as `mgmt-kubeconfig`.

<!-- -->

1.  Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable:

    ``` terminal
    $ export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)/mgmt-kubeconfig"
    ```

2.  Verify that all nodes are in a `Ready` state:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get nodes
    ```

# Configure worker nodes for DPU operation

You must deploy the `dpu-worker-config` Helm chart to configure worker nodes with DPUs before adding those nodes to the management cluster. The `dpu-worker-config` Helm chart creates the `MachineConfigPool`, `dpu-worker-configuration` MachineConfig, and other required resources that configure the bridge, OVS services, and IP routing on worker nodes. The `MachineConfigPool` groups DPU-equipped worker nodes so that the Machine Config Operator can apply DPU-specific configurations to them.

The MachineConfig resource performs several configuration tasks required by DPF:

- **Bridge Configuration**: Creates a `br-ex` bridge interface that enables communication between the DPU and the hosted cluster control plane running on the management cluster. This name must match the `dpuNodeOOBBridgeName` value in the `DPFOperatorConfig` resource, or DPU provisioning fails. For more information refer to [DPF Operator Prerequisites](https://networking-docs.nvidia.com/dpf/26.4.1/host-network-configuration-prerequisites).

- **OVS Service Management**: Disables OpenShift’s default OVS services on x86 worker nodes. This is required for OVN-Kubernetes DPU Host mode operation, where networking functions are offloaded to the DPU rather than running on the host CPU.

- **IP Rules Configuration**: Sets routing rules required for pod-to-host control-plane traffic.

<!-- -->

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

- The Helm CLI (`helm`) is installed on your workstation.

- You have a pull secret file that includes credentials for `registry.redhat.io`. Helm reads its registry credentials from this file, which is separate from the container runtime configuration.

1.  Set the `OPENSHIFT_PULL_SECRET` environment variable to the path of your pull secret file:

    ``` terminal
    $ export OPENSHIFT_PULL_SECRET="/root/pull-secret.txt"
    ```

2.  Deploy the `dpu-worker-config` Helm chart:

    ``` terminal
    $ helm upgrade --install dpu-worker-config \
        oci://registry.redhat.io/dpu-kit-for-nvidia/dpu-worker-config-chart \
        --version 4.22.0 \
        --registry-config "${OPENSHIFT_PULL_SECRET}" \
        --namespace dpf-hcp-provisioner-system \
        --create-namespace \
        --disable-openapi-validation
    ```

- Verify that the `dpu-worker-config` Helm release is deployed:

  ``` terminal
  $ helm list -n dpf-hcp-provisioner-system
  ```

- Verify that the `MachineConfigPool` was created automatically:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get mcp worker-dpu
  ```

# Create the DPF namespace

You must create a dedicated namespace for the DPF Operator and its components before installing the Operator.

- You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

<!-- -->

- Create the `dpf-operator-system` namespace:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc create namespace dpf-operator-system
  ```

<!-- -->

- Verify that the namespace was created:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get namespace dpf-operator-system
  ```

# Required Operators

Before you install the DPF Operator, you must install the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, MetalLB Operator, Red Hat OpenShift GitOps, and NVIDIA Maintenance Operator.

The multicluster engine Operator and the Node Feature Discovery Operator can be installed during management cluster creation by using the Assisted Installer. If you did not install the multicluster engine Operator, follow "Install the multicluster engine Operator" before configuring the required Operators.

## Install the multicluster engine Operator

If you did not install the multicluster engine Operator by using the Assisted Installer, install it from the OpenShift CLI. You do not need to install Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management or create a `MultiClusterHub` resource to use the multicluster engine Operator. If the Assisted Installer already created a `MultiClusterEngine` resource, skip this procedure.

- You have access to the management cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

- No `MultiClusterEngine` resource exists on the cluster.

- If you already have an existing `MultiClusterEngine` resource with a different name, note that the following verification commands use `mce`. Substitute your resource’s name where needed.

1.  Check which multicluster engine channels are available from the `redhat-operators` catalog:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace -l catalog=redhat-operators \
      -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.name=="multicluster-engine")].status.channels[*].name}{"\n"}'
    ```

    The following example uses `stable-2.17`, which is the channel used by this deployment. If your catalog does not offer this channel, select a supported channel for your OpenShift version before continuing.

2.  Create a file named `mce-operator.yaml` with the following content:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: multicluster-engine
    ---
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
    kind: OperatorGroup
    metadata:
      name: multicluster-engine
      namespace: multicluster-engine
    spec:
      targetNamespaces:
      - multicluster-engine
    ---
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Subscription
    metadata:
      name: multicluster-engine
      namespace: multicluster-engine
    spec:
      channel: stable-2.17
      name: multicluster-engine
      source: redhat-operators
      sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
      installPlanApproval: Automatic
    ```

    If you selected a different supported channel, replace `stable-2.17` with that channel in the file.

3.  Apply the file:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc apply -f mce-operator.yaml
    ```

4.  Wait until the multicluster engine Operator CSV reports `Succeeded` and the `MultiClusterEngine` CRD is established:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csv -n multicluster-engine
    $ oc wait crd/multiclusterengines.multicluster.openshift.io --for=create --timeout=10m
    $ oc wait crd/multiclusterengines.multicluster.openshift.io --for=condition=Established --timeout=5m
    ```

    Repeat the CSV check until its phase is `Succeeded` before creating the custom resource.

5.  Create a file named `mce.yaml` with the following content:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MultiClusterEngine
    metadata:
      name: mce
    spec:
      overrides:
        components:
        - name: hypershift
          enabled: true
    ```

6.  Apply the file:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc apply -f mce.yaml
    ```

- Wait for the `MultiClusterEngine` resource to become available:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc wait multiclusterengine/mce --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Available --timeout=15m
  ```

- Verify that the hosted control plane component is enabled:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get multiclusterengine mce -o jsonpath='{.spec.overrides.components[?(@.name=="hypershift")].enabled}{"\n"}'
  ```

  <div class="formalpara-title">

  **Example output**

  </div>

  ``` terminal
  true
  ```

      --for=condition=Available --timeout=120s
    ```

11. Enable global IP forwarding on the OVN-Kubernetes configuration:

    This command enables IP packet forwarding between different networks managed by OVN-Kubernetes.

    ``` terminal
    $ oc patch network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge -p \
      '{"spec":{"defaultNetwork":{"ovnKubernetesConfig":{"gatewayConfig":{"ipForwarding":"Global"}}}}}'
    ```

- Verify that the `MultiClusterEngine` instance is created:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get multiclusterengine mce
  ```

  <div class="formalpara-title">

  **Example output**

  </div>

  ``` terminal
  NAME   STATUS      AGE     CURRENTVERSION   DESIREDVERSION   MESSAGE
  mce    Available   4m58s   2.17.2           2.17.2           All components available
  ```

- Verify that the hosted control plane component is enabled:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get multiclusterengine mce -o jsonpath='{.spec.overrides.components[?(@.name=="hypershift")].enabled}{"\n"}'
  ```

  <div class="note">

  The manual installation procedure creates `mce` with `hypershift` enabled. If the previous command returns `true`, no further action is needed. If it returns `false` or an empty result, you must enable the `hypershift` component before DPU provisioning can succeed.

  </div>

  To enable the `hypershift` component on the `MultiClusterEngine` resource, use the following steps. In current multicluster engine Operator versions the component is named `hypershift`. Earlier versions use `hypershift-preview`.

  - If the result is empty, check whether the `components` list exists:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get multiclusterengine mce -o jsonpath='{.spec.overrides.components}{"\n"}'
    ```

    If the list exists but has no `hypershift` entry, append it without replacing the other components:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc patch multiclusterengine mce --type=json \
        -p='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/overrides/components/-","value":{"name":"hypershift","enabled":true}}]'
    ```

    If the list is absent, edit the resource instead and create `spec.overrides.components` with an entry named `hypershift` set to `enabled: true`.

  - If the result is `false`, an entry exists but is disabled. Edit the resource and set the `hypershift` component to `enabled: true`:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc edit multiclusterengine mce
    ```

    <div class="important">

    Do not use `oc patch --type=merge` to enable the component, because a merge patch replaces the entire `components` array and removes the other components. Use the JSON `add` patch only when the `components` list exists. Otherwise, use `oc edit`.

    </div>

- Verify that the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` instance and `NodeFeatureRule` are configured:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get nodefeaturediscovery,nodefeaturerule -n openshift-nfd
  ```

- Verify that the `MetalLB` instance was created:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get metallb -n openshift-operators
  ```

- Verify that the Argo CD pods are running:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get pods -n dpf-operator-system | grep argocd
  ```

- Verify that IP forwarding is set to `Global`:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get network.operator.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.defaultNetwork.ovnKubernetesConfig.gatewayConfig.ipForwarding}'
  ```

  <div class="formalpara-title">

  **Example output**

  </div>

  ``` terminal
  Global
  ```
