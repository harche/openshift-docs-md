After the DPF Operator and the hosted cluster are configured, adjust the OVN-Kubernetes CNI settings, add DPU-equipped worker nodes to the management cluster, and provision the DPUs.

# Enable the OVN-Kubernetes resource injector

You can install the OVN-Kubernetes resource injector by using Helm to deploy a mutating admission webhook that automatically injects SR-IOV virtual function resource requests and network attachment annotations into each pod scheduled to a worker node.

<div class="note">

Virtual function resource capacity on worker nodes is provided by the `NodeSRIOVDevicePluginConfig` resource, which replaces the manual SR-IOV device plugin `DaemonSet` and control plane node patching used in earlier DPF versions.

</div>

- You have access to the management cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- You have installed the `helm` CLI.

- You have set the DPF Operator environment variables. For details, see "DPF Operator installation environment variables".

- You have created the `NodeSRIOVDevicePluginConfig` resource.

1.  Install the OVN-Kubernetes resource injector by using Helm:

    ``` terminal
    $ helm upgrade --install -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes ovn-kubernetes \
      "$OVN_TEMPLATE_CHART_URL/ovn-kubernetes-chart" \
      --version "${OVN_CHART_VERSION}" \
      --skip-crds \
      --set ovn-kubernetes-resource-injector.enabled=true \
      --set ovn-kubernetes-resource-injector.resourceName="openshift.io/bf3_vfs" \
      --set ovn-kubernetes-resource-injector.prioritizeOffloading=false \
      --set ovn-kubernetes-resource-injector.controllerManager.hostNetwork=true \
      --set ovn-kubernetes-resource-injector.controllerManager.webhookPort="19443" \

# OVN-Kubernetes DPU-Host mode

DPU-Host mode on worker nodes with accelerated OVN-Kubernetes CNI is automatically configured by the DPF provisioning controller.

When the `DPFOperatorConfig` resource is created and worker nodes with the `worker-dpu` label are provisioned, the DPF provisioning controller automatically configures the required settings for DPU-Host mode, including the network node identity and hardware offload configuration.

# Add worker nodes by using the Bare Metal Operator

You can add DPU-equipped worker nodes to the management cluster by creating `BareMetalHost` resources that the Bare Metal Operator provisions.

- You have access to the management cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- You have installed the Bare Metal Operator on the management cluster.

- Physical worker servers with Redfish-compatible BMC, iDRAC, or iLO access are available.

- Network connectivity exists from the management cluster to the worker BMC interfaces.

- You have the BMC IP address and access credentials for each server.

- You have the MAC address of the management network interface for each server.

- You have the name of the root disk device for each server.

1.  Set the following environment variables for the worker node:

    ``` terminal
    $ export BMC_IP=<bmc_ip_address>
    $ export BMC_USER=<bmc_username>
    $ export BMC_PASSWORD=<bmc_password>
    $ export WORKER_NAME=<worker_name>
    $ export BOOT_MAC=<management_interface_mac>
    $ export ROOT_DEVICE=<root_device_path>
    ```

    where:

    `<bmc_ip_address>`
    Specifies the IP address of the worker node BMC interface.

    `<bmc_username>`
    Specifies the username for BMC access.

    `<bmc_password>`
    Specifies the password for BMC access.

    `<worker_name>`
    Specifies a name for the worker node, such as `worker-01`.

    `<management_interface_mac>`
    Specifies the MAC address of the out-of-band management interface, such as `00:00:5E:00:53:01`.

    `<root_device_path>`
    Specifies the path to the root disk device, such as `/dev/nvme0n1`.

2.  Verify BMC connectivity from one of the control plane nodes:

    ``` terminal
    $ ping $BMC_IP
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ curl -k https://$BMC_IP/redfish/v1/
    ```

    ``` terminal
    $ curl -k -u $BMC_USER:$BMC_PASSWORD https://$BMC_IP/redfish/v1/Systems
    ```

3.  Verify that the Bare Metal Operator is available:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get clusteroperator baremetal
    ```

4.  Create a file named `provisioning.yaml` with the following content to disable the provisioning network:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Provisioning
    metadata:
      name: provisioning-configuration
    spec:
      provisioningNetwork: "Disabled"
      watchAllNamespaces: false
    ```

    <div class="important">

    When `provisioningNetwork` is set to `Disabled`, servers boot by using Redfish virtual media instead of PXE.

    </div>

5.  Apply the `Provisioning` resource:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc apply -f provisioning.yaml
    ```

6.  Create a file named `bmc-secret.yaml` with the following content to store the BMC credentials:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: ${WORKER_NAME}-bmc-secret
      namespace: openshift-machine-api
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      username: ${BMC_USER}
      password: ${BMC_PASSWORD}
    ```

7.  Apply the BMC credentials secret:

    ``` terminal
    $ envsubst < bmc-secret.yaml | oc apply -f -
    ```

8.  Create a file named `baremetalhost.yaml`. The `userData` secret determines the node type:

    - For a DPU-equipped worker node, reference the `worker-dpu-user-data-managed` secret:

      ``` yaml
      apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
      kind: BareMetalHost
      metadata:
        name: $WORKER_NAME
        namespace: openshift-machine-api
      spec:
        online: true
        bootMACAddress: $BOOT_MAC
        rootDeviceHints:
          deviceName: $ROOT_DEVICE
        bmc:
          address: redfish-virtualmedia+https://$BMC_IP
          credentialsName: $WORKER_NAME-bmc-secret
          disableCertificateVerification: true
        customDeploy:
          method: install_coreos
        userData:
          name: worker-dpu-user-data-managed
          namespace: openshift-machine-api
      ```

    - For a regular worker node without a DPU, reference the `worker-user-data-managed` secret instead:

      ``` yaml
      apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
      kind: BareMetalHost
      metadata:
        name: $WORKER_NAME
        namespace: openshift-machine-api
      spec:
        online: true
        bootMACAddress: $BOOT_MAC
        rootDeviceHints:
          deviceName: $ROOT_DEVICE
        bmc:
          address: redfish-virtualmedia+https://$BMC_IP
          credentialsName: $WORKER_NAME-bmc-secret
          disableCertificateVerification: true
        customDeploy:
          method: install_coreos
        userData:
          name: worker-user-data-managed
          namespace: openshift-machine-api
      ```

      <div class="important">

      Adding a regular worker node without a DPU is a Technology Preview feature.

      </div>

9.  Apply the `BareMetalHost` resource:

    ``` terminal
    $ envsubst < baremetalhost.yaml | oc apply -f -
    ```

- Monitor the provisioning progress:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get bmh -n openshift-machine-api -w
  ```

  <div class="formalpara-title">

  **Example output**

  </div>

  ``` terminal

# Approve worker node CSRs

You must approve the pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) for worker nodes that join the management cluster.

<div class="note">

Worker nodes provisioned by using a `BareMetalHost` resource do not have an associated `Machine` object, so the default OpenShift machine approver does not automatically approve their certificate signing requests (CSRs). You must manually approve the `kube-apiserver-client-kubelet` CSR from the `node-bootstrapper` service account and the `kubelet-serving` CSR from the node for each worker node.

</div>

- You have access to the management cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- Worker nodes are booted and attempting to join the management cluster.

1.  Watch for pending CSRs:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr -w
    ```

2.  Approve all pending CSRs:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
    ```

    <div class="formalpara-title">

    **Example output**

    </div>

    ``` terminal
    certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/csr-27bgq approved
    certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/csr-69g65 approved
    certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/csr-7r862 approved
    certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/csr-f5vk7 approved
    ```

    Repeat this step until no pending CSRs remain. Each node typically generates multiple CSRs.

3.  Verify that the worker nodes joined the cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get nodes
    ```

    <div class="formalpara-title">

    **Example output**

    </div>

    ``` terminal

    master-2           Ready      control-plane,master,worker   4d22h   v1.35.6
    ```

    <div class="note">

    The worker nodes show a status of `NotReady` until the DPU provisioning process is fully completed and all OVN-Kubernetes CNI components on the host and the DPU are running. Do not proceed to the next steps until all pending CSRs are approved.

    </div>

# Verify DPU provisioning

After the worker nodes join the management cluster, the `DPUSet` controller automatically detects nodes with the `feature.node.kubernetes.io/dpu-enabled` label, which the Node Feature Discovery Operator applies to DPU-equipped nodes. The controller then creates a `DPU` object for each node and starts the provisioning process. You can monitor the provisioning stages to verify progress.

- You have access to the management cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- The worker node CSRs are approved and the nodes have joined the management cluster.

1.  Watch for `DPU` object creation:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get dpu -n dpf-operator-system -w
    ```

    <div class="formalpara-title">

    **Example output**

    The `DPU` objects progress through the following provisioning stages:

    `Initializing`
    The `DPU` object is created.

    `OS Installing`
    The BFB installation is in progress.

    `Rebooting`
    The host and DPU are resetting.

    `DPU Cluster Config`
    The DPU Kubernetes node join procedure is in progress. Manual CSR approval is required during this stage.

    `Host Network Configuration`
    Networking configuration adjustments are applied on the host.

    `Ready`
    The DPU is successfully provisioned and ready to use.

    `Error`
    Provisioning failed. Check events and conditions for details.

    <div class="important">

    When the provisioning stage reaches `DPU Cluster Config`, proceed to "Configure authorization for the hosted cluster" and "Approve DPU node CSRs" to complete the DPU node join process.

2.  Monitor detailed provisioning progress:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc -n dpf-operator-system exec deploy/dpf-operator-controller-manager -- /dpfctl describe dpudeployments
    ```

3.  Optional: View detailed status for a specific `DPU` object:

    In the following command, replace `<dpu_name>` with the name of the `DPU` resource:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc describe dpu -n dpf-operator-system <dpu_name>
    ```

4.  Optional: Follow the provisioning controller logs for a specific DPU:

    In the following command, replace `<dpu_name>` with the name of the `DPU` resource:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc logs -n dpf-operator-system -l dpu.nvidia.com/component=dpf-provisioning-controller-manager --tail=-1 -f | grep <dpu_name>
    ```

# Configure authorization for the hosted cluster

DPF services running on DPU nodes require privileged access to host networking and devices. You must create a `ClusterRoleBinding` on the hosted cluster that grants the `privileged` security context constraint (SCC) to all service accounts in the `dpf-operator-system` namespace.

- You have access to the hosted cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- The hosted cluster kubeconfig file is available.

- DPU provisioning has reached the `DPU Cluster Config` stage.

1.  Get the hosted cluster kubeconfig:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get secret $HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME-admin-kubeconfig -n $CLUSTERS_NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' | base64 -d > $HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME.kubeconfig
    ```

2.  Switch to the hosted cluster context:

    ``` terminal
    $ export KUBECONFIG=$HOSTED_CLUSTER_NAME.kubeconfig
    ```

3.  Create a file named `dpu-cluster-scc.yaml` with the following content:

    ``` yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: dpf-system-scc-privileged
      labels:

    - kind: Group
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      name: system:serviceaccounts:dpf-operator-system
    ```

4.  Apply the resource file on the hosted cluster:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc apply -f dpu-cluster-scc.yaml
    ```

# Approve hosted cluster CSRs for DPU provisioning

You must approve the pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) for DPU nodes on the hosted cluster so that the DPU nodes can join the hosted cluster and complete provisioning.

<div class="note">

When you use the DPF HCP Provisioner Operator, DPU CSR approval is handled automatically. Manual approval is provided as a fallback if automatic approval is not functioning.

</div>

- You have access to the hosted cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- You have set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the hosted cluster kubeconfig file.

- DPU provisioning has reached the `DPU Cluster Config` stage.

1.  Watch for pending CSRs from the DPU nodes:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr -w
    ```

    The DPU node name typically follows the pattern `<host_worker_node_name>-<dpu_serial_number>`.

2.  Approve all pending CSRs:

    ``` terminal
    $ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
    ```

    <div class="formalpara-title">

    ``` terminal
    certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/csr-6jx22 approved
    certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/csr-tb6nd approved
    ```

    Repeat this step until no pending CSRs remain.

- Verify that the DPU nodes joined the hosted cluster and are in a `Ready` state:

  ``` terminal
  $ oc get nodes
  ```

  <div class="formalpara-title">

# Verify full system readiness

After the DPU provisioning process completes, you can verify that all worker nodes, SR-IOV virtual functions, and DPU services are operational on the management cluster.

- You have access to the management cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

- You have installed the `oc` CLI.

- DPU provisioning has completed.

1.  Switch back to the management cluster context:

    ``` terminal
    $ export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)/mgmt-kubeconfig"
    ```

2.  Verify that all worker nodes are in a `Ready` state:

    ``` terminal
